# JARVIS-AI-Assistant-using-python

Speech recognition is the process of converting audio into text. This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. Python provides an API called Speech Recognition to allow us to convert audio into text for further processing.

Flow of execution


1)	Installing & Importing all required libraries:

Pyttsx3: - This module is used for conversion of text to speech in a program it works offline. 

Wikipedia: - As we all know Wikipedia is a great source of knowledge, we have used Wikipedia module to get information from Wikipedia or to perform Wikipedia search. 

Speech Recognition: - Application of voice assistant, one of the most important things in this is that our assistant recognizes our voice (means what you want to say/ ask). 

Web browser: - To perform Web Search. This module comes built-in with Python.

Datetime: - Date and Time is used to showing Date and Time. This module comes built-int with Python.

Requests: Requests is used for making GET and POST requests.

Pyfirmata: Pyfirmata is prebuilt library package of python program. which can be installed in Arduino to allow serial communication between a python script on any computer and an Arduino. This python package can give access to read and write any pin on the Arduino.


2)	Setting our engine & Arduino:

•	we will set our engine to Pyttsx3 which is used for text to speech in Python and sapi5 is Microsoft speech application platform interface we will be using this for text to speech function.

•	We are giving access to read and write any pin on the Arduino board.

Theoretical explanation:

Functionalities: -

•	We can open different kind of websites like google, stack overflow, YouTube, etc.

•	We can open applications like VS Code, Microsoft word, etc. within our system.

•	We can play songs and we can also list out all the songs.

•	We can also show short information on a particular subject through Wikipedia.

•	The assistant is also able to great us (good morning, good evening) according to whatever time it is.

“We interface hardware (Arduino) for Future Home Automation Purpose, we just giving the command to the JARVIS like on the Light, Fan, Tv, etc.
Now we just interface the led for giving command to the JARVIS to On and Off the led.”


Software:

                                 

•	We using visual Studio Code editor to write and edit our code.
•	We are using python. It is a suitable language for script writers and developers.
•	we will look at converting large or long audio files into text using the Speech Recognition API in python.

Hardware:

                                  
•	we using Arduino (Microcontroller) and LED.
•	For controlling the Arduino, we using Pyfirmata library package of python program.
